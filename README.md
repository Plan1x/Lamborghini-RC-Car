# ðŸš˜Lamborghini RC car 


Radio controlled car based on Stm32 controller. Using LoRa sx1278 transceiver module and ADC regular channels with configured DMA interrupts.

# ðŸ“œ A short story about the project
Recently, while sorting out my old things, I came across a long-forgotten toy - a radio-controlled car. I received it as a New Year's gift when I was 14. After examining the car, I realized that all the electronics in it were damaged. This prompted me to create a completely new machine using modern technology. The electronics and firmware in the radio-controlled car and remote control have been completely replaced with more modern ones. The radio-controlled car has received a new life.
